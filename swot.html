            <h1>Amazon SWOT Analysis</h1>
            <p>Amazon is a trillion dollar company with limitless capital to purchase resources, companies, and talent.
                But money can't solve all problems, and certainly not all of Amazon's</p>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Strengths</h2>
                        <div>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Amazon is a big company with a huge customer base and money. In 2021 Amazon has a 33.36 Billion dollar net income. Amazon's subscription service, Amazon Prime, has more than 200 million prime members worldwide</li>
                                <li>Amazon is the largest e-commerge platform and Amazon's Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the leader of cloud service providers. Amazon's online retail business has a total of 40.4% of total ecommerce sales, far outshining second place Walmart with only 7.1% and third place eBay with 4.3% of total ecommerce sales respectively in 2020. AWS is first place with a 33% market share, outshining Microsoft Azure with 21% and Google Cloud with 8% in the first quarterly of 2022</li>
                                <li>Amazon is a good customer oriented company with world class service with dedicated customers. Through its good return policy, user experience through the Amazon app, and the power through countless products on its platform.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                        <h2>Weaknesses</h2>
                        <div>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The trust in quality, or even validity of Amazon's products on its platform is undermining the trust from consumers. Amazon said that they seized and destroyed 2 million counterfeit products in 2020 that were sent to Amazon warehouses and blocked more than 10 billion suspected bad listings before they were even published. Investigations by CNBC found that Amazon has shipped expired food to customers, Amazon being rifed with fake reviews also doesn't help consumer confidence </li>
                                <li>For several years Amazon has faced controversies over paying little to no taxes despite generating billions in profits. The institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP) alleged that amazon avoided about $5.2 billion in corporate federal income tax in 2021, paying only 6% of its record $35 billion in profit during that year. The ITEP alleged that if Amazon had no tax breaks it would have paid 21% which is $7.3 billion in taxes isntead of the $2.1 billion it really paid</li>
                                <li>The turnover rate of Amazon is so high even its executives are concerned that it would run out of new hires. According to the Times, Amazon has an annual turnover rate of roughly 150% each year. Several reasons to why that is include the stress, how cutthroat it is, micromanagement, and how the environment doesn't care about the employees.</li>

                        <div>
                            <ul>
                                <li>In 2017 Amazon spent $13 billion to buy Whole Foods, which opens the door to entering the grocery store markets and food delivery with Amazon Fresh.</li>
                                <li>Amazon is also exploring the technology with drone delivery with Amazon Prime Air Drone Delivery</li>
                                <li>Amazon could also tap into the gaming industry with the purchase of Twitch, the largest live streaming platform for gaming</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
