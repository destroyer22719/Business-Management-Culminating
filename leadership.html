            <p>
                Jeff Bezos effectively plans by planning for the growth and expansion of his company, releasing new
                products and
                services such as Amazon Web Services which later on became the largest cloud service provider to this
                day. He
                also demonstrated strong organizational skills when Amazon expanded to eventually become the largest
                online
                after overcoming other competitors during that time. Jeff Bezos is also good and leading because he
                ensures his
                employees share the same vision as Amazon&apos;s. Jeff Bezos is effective at controlling, particularily
                with
                finances as Amazon always turned a profit in all the years it went public (with the exception of the
                2008 and
                2009 recession like almost every other company) and turning it into the tech giant it is today.
